This program takes user input to determine the number of rows and columns for a matrix. 
The user then enters the elements of the matrix, which are stored in a two-dimensional array. 
Once the matrix is populated, it is displayed on the screen. 
To compute the transpose of the matrix, the program swaps the rows and columns, storing the transposed values in a new two-dimensional array. 
Finally, the transposed matrix is printed, showing the modified arrangement where rows become columns and vice versa.
